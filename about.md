![Working in Naik Lab](/assets/img/microscope.JPG)

I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student in Applied Physics at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Amir Safavi-Naeini in the [Laboratory for Nanoscale Integrated Quantum Systems](https://linqs.stanford.edu/). I'm designing nonlinear integrated photonic devices and using them for applications in spectroscopy and sensing.

Previously, I was a <a href="https://www.churchillscholarship.org/">Churchill Scholar</a> and MPhil student at <a href="https://www.np.phy.cam.ac.uk/">NanoPhotonics Centre</a>, University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Jeremy Baumberg. For undergrad, I graduated from Rice University with a double-major, <i>summa cum laude</i> in physics and electrical engineering. My work at Rice's <a href="http://naik.rice.edu/">Naik Lab</a> helped me grow from someone with literally zero experience in the field of optics/photonics, and I am infinitely grateful for their support. During undergrad, I also had amazing internship experiences as a <a href="http://nakatani-ries.rice.edu/">Nakatani RIES Fellow</a> in the <a href="http://www.iae.kyoto-u.ac.jp/conv/en/index.html">Matsuda Lab</a>, Kyoto University, and as an <a href="https://e3s-center.berkeley.edu/education-diversity/education/undergraduate/reu-summer-research-experience-undergraduates/reu-program-archive/2018-2/">E3S REU Fellow</a> at the <a href="http://www.mingwulab.berkeley.edu/">Integrated Photonics Lab</a>, UC Berkeley. 

Outside of lab, I love playing viola, listening to classical music and R&B, and playing pickup basketball.
